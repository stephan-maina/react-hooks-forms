# Controlled Form Component - Readme

Welcome to the "Controlled Form Component" repository! This repository contains a React component that demonstrates the concept of a controlled form using React's state management.

# Description

The "Controlled Form Component" is a simple React component that showcases how to create a controlled form in React. In a controlled form, the form inputs are tied to the component's state, ensuring that the form data is always synchronized with the state. This approach allows for more control over form data, enabling easier manipulation, validation, and data sharing between components.

# Getting Started

To use the "Controlled Form Component" in your project, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a zip file.

Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Import the ControlledForm component into your project.

Place the ControlledForm component within your application's hierarchy and use it as needed.

# How It Works

The "Controlled Form Component" utilizes the useState hook from React to manage the form data as component state. The component consists of two input fields for the first name and last name, respectively. The initial values for these input fields are set to "Stephan" and "Mkadinali," but the user can change these values by typing in the input fields.

The input fields are controlled by updating the state whenever the user interacts with them. Two event handler functions, handleFirstNameChange and handleLastNameChange, are responsible for updating the state when the input values change.

By using controlled components, any changes made to the input fields trigger a re-render of the component, and the input values are always synchronized with the component state.

# Usage Example

To use the "Controlled Form Component" in your application, follow these steps:

Import the ControlledForm component into your React application:
jsx
Copy code
import React from "react";
import ControlledForm from "./ControlledForm";
// Additional imports and code for your application
Place the ControlledForm component within your application's hierarchy:
jsx
Copy code
function App() {
  // Your application code
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Your other components */}
      <ControlledForm />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
Run your application, and you will see the "Controlled Form Component" rendered with the input fields for first name and last name. Any changes you make to the input fields will be reflected in the component state and displayed accordingly.
